# JnrPeter.Sales-Performance-Analysis-in-Excel

The dataset was about the performance of sales personnel and cookie products in six (6) different countries. The dataset was cleaned by removing duplicates. A quick analysis of the data such as average, median etc. was first performed using formulas to get an overview of the dataset. Conditional Formatting was applied to the dataset to see how varied the data was. Then the data analysis was performed mostly using pivot tables to answer certain questions.

The following questions motivated the data Analysis:

   •	Sales per country
   •	Top five Products by dollar per unit
   •	Best Sales person in each country by total amount of sales
   •	Profits made by Sales Personnel
   •	Top ten best performing products by percentage profits
   •	Products that did not make any profits.


Finally an interactive dashboard and a dynamic sales report was developed using the analyzed data.
